# MINI_PROJECT
Electricity Bill Generation 1st Phase

In this Project i have worked on Electricity Bill mostly used in Banglore city.
Covered all the details in which how elctricity bill is generated.In this project all details of topics are performed [like..,Exception handling,Logging,Loops,Conditional Statements,Functions etc].This project is just Phase 1 were i have included above topics only.

In Phase 2 i will be performing on Object Oriented Concepts and that will be uploaded as Electricity Bill generation Phase||  and i will try to create Modules and Packages along with it.

In Phase 3 i will try to collect to 10-20 bill and enter that bill details (like MR code ,RR No and Tariff Details) and store this details in Database using SQL and we will try to store previous readings.

So that the person who is taking Bill Incharge just need to enter MR code Or RR no and Present readings so the entire bill will be exceuted.


This mini project will be avalilable in two files .ipynb and .py both the format . I would recommed to do this project or to know about this project use Py charm or Vscode and you can just change the loggging name and create an new logging file in your own system .
